AWS RDS Server Density plugin
=============================

This plugin allows to monitor AWS RDS instances. It is based on the [Percona Monitoring Tools](https://github.com/percona/percona-monitoring-plugins/blob/master/cacti/scripts/ss_get_rds_stats.py) and uses [Python Boto](http://boto.cloudhackers.com/en/latest/) to query AWS CloudWatch.

Every minute it pulls the 2 minute average from Cloudwatch and posts that to Server Density. The reason it pulls a 2 minute average rather than a 1 minute average is that when pulling a 1 minute average CPU utilization is not available.

In the configuration you can get data from multiple endpoints by separating the endpoints through a comma. However, due to the nature of Boto making a request for each metric it's advisable to not have too many endpoints to allow the agent to make postbacks every minute.

Setup
-----

1. Install python-boto `sudo apt-get install python-boto`
2. Configure the plugin in `/etc/sd-agent/plugins.cfg`
     ```
     [RDS]
      aws_access_key_id = YOUR_KEY_ID
      aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
      endpoints = RDS_ENDPOINT1,RDS_ENDPOINT2
     ```

3. Drop the RDS.py script in your plugin directory, most likely `/usr/local/share/sd-plugins/`. Check your `config.cfg` if you're unsure.
4. Restart the agent to apply changes `sudo service sd-agent restart`

Troubleshooting
---------------

You can run the script directly from the command line to collect the metrics:

```
$ python RDS.py -k YOUR_ACCESS_KEY -p YOUR_SECRET -e YOUR_ENDPOINT

}
```

Additional Notes
----------------

This plugin requires at least python-boto 2.35.2, Ubuntu 14.04 can use [Chris Lea's PPA](https://launchpad.net/~chris-lea/+archive/ubuntu/python-boto).
